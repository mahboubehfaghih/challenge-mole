## Mission objectives

- Be able to apply a CNN in a real context
- Be able to preprocess data for computer vision
- Be able to evaluate your model (split dataset, confusion matrix, hyper-parameter tuning, etc)
- Be able to visualize your model results and evaluations (properly labeled, titled...)
- Be able to deploy your solution in an simple APP locally or on Heroku

## The Mission

This is a job we received from the company "skinCare". The job entailed that we would develop a website that would be able to classify pictures of moles.

The dataset provided by the client is here https://www.kaggle.com/kmader/skin-cancer-mnist-ham10000

Possible disease states are "Melanoma", "Melanocytic nevus", "Basal cell carcinoma", "Actinic keratosis / Bowenâ€™s disease (intraepithelial carcinoma)", "Benign keratosis (solar lentigo / seborrheic keratosis / lichen planus-like keratosis)", "Dermatofibroma", and "Vascular lesion". Approximately 10,000 images provided for training, 200 for validation, 1500 for test.
